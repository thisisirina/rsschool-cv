## About Myself

I am able to handle multiple tasks on a daily basis. I have experience working as part of a team and individually. I am flexible in my working hours, being able to work evenings and weekends. I was a part of a marketing team. On that position I was working with designers creating banners, leaflets, catalogues etc, as well as organizing events for companies' clients. I'm currently working as an account manager in a SMM company. I am always energetic and eager to learn new skills. Progamming facinates me.
